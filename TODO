Long-Term
=========

* Rewrite Type::Tiny::Manual.

* Try to make inlining for ClassName, RoleName, StrMatch, etc more
  suitable for things like Mite. Perhaps add a separate method to type
  constraints for generating a string of Perl code that can be compiled
  and executed without the presence of Type::Tiny and the type library.

* Resolve RT#102457. Error::TypeTiny::Assertion needs a better way of
  identifying which stack frame to report the error at, or Type::Params
  needs to mark its compiled subs more clearly.

* Resolve RT#121763. Need to figure out the circumstances under which
  this happens and fix.

* Resolve RT#120226 if HAARG will help me flesh out an API.

* Overhaul is_subtype_of stuff.
