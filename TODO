Post-1.000000 Changes
=====================

* Try to make inlining for ClassName, RoleName, StrMatch, etc more
  suitable for things like Mite.

* Inform Type::Coercion when it *should have* been frozen (for example,
  the parameterized ArrayRef, HashRef, Dict, and Tuple coercion
  generators). 
  
  After that, $coercion->add_type_coercions can issue a warning about
  that bad things are happening. On Perl 5.10, this can be done with
  warnings::warnif. On earlier Perls that mechanism is unreliable, so
  just use plain old warn.

* Investigate popular type constraints defined outside Type-Tiny, and
  consider which can be added to Types::Standard/Types::Common::*.
  These would need to be constraints that can be implemented with no
  non-core dependencies.

* Possibly add a NonEmpty type constraint, allowing NonEmpty[Str],
  NonEmpty[HashRef[Int]], NonEmpty[ArrayRef], etc. This would be an
  interesting one for optimizing.

* CycleTuple[Int,Str,HashRef] should allow [1,foo=>{},2,bar=>{}].

* Perhaps allow Type::Coercion::FromMoose's implementation of
  add_type_coercions to succeed?

* to_TypeTiny's _TypeTinyFromGeneric could support inlining?

* Investigate some more method overrides in Type::Tiny::Union - look at
  what Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Union does.
