  * Type-Tiny
      * Improve API for parameterized coercions
      * Consider ways to reduce duplication when definition a type
        constraint coderef plus inline code
      * Maybe[`a] should have a coercion if `a does???
      * Documentation
          * See what questions users come up with, and write more
            documentation if necessary
          * Document Type::Utils - don't just point people at Moose
      * Test cases
          * Type::Registry needs a few more test cases
          * Type::Parser needs lots of test cases
              * Check every type of token in the grammar, inclusing
                qr{}, qq{}, q{}, fat comma, class types, etc
              * Test precedence works - e.g. Foo|~Bar&Baz
          * Test cases for InstanceOf, ConsumerOf, HasMethods, Enum
            type constraints
      * Hassle mst about exception API for constraints and coercions in
        Moo
          * Implement what needs to be implemented at Type::Exception's
