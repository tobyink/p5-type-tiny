# Type-Tiny Security Policy

The [latest stable release on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/Type-Tiny)
is supported for security updates. (By convention, releases with an underscore
in their version number are not considered to be stable releases.)

If you are using an older release, you are advised to upgrade.

A list of changes between versions can be found in
[the Changes file on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/changes/distribution/Type-Tiny)
with security-related changes tagged "SECURITY" in capital letters.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any issues via [RT](https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Type-Tiny).

If you are concerned that some of the details of your report may lead to an
exploit being made public, then keep your issue report vague, and email the
details to me directly. My email address can be found on my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/tobyink).
